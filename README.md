## Description
Classic Where's Waldo game where a picture is shown to the user to find the characters proposed.

The user can click anywhere within the picture bounds if one of the characters is found, a dropdown will appear and
the user will be able to select which character was found from a list of characters.

The locations of the characters are registered and then checked on a Firebase database to see if the location clicked is
correct.

The application has a timer to set how long did the user take to find all the characters.

Once the game ends, the user will be asked to insert an alias within a modal to registers its score to a leaderboard, where
all the scores registered are stored in a Firebase database.
